# Code challenge for backend developers

A code challenge offered to backend engineers applying for an open
position at Babbel. The main purpose of the challenge is to help you show us
your engineering skills. Your implementation of the Echo is used later as part
of the technical interview.

## Where to find the description of the challenge?

A full technical specification and a couple of examples are provided in
[echo.md][echo.md] file. Take your time to read it carefully.

## How to deliver the results?

It isn't necessary to deploy your solution anywhere. It's enough to send us a
link on *a public* repository on GitHub or GitLab. The README should include
instructions on how to run and test the project on a local machine. Ideally, it
should only require a couple of commands to make the server up and running.

We will have Ruby/PHP and Bundler/Composer installed on our machines,
so there is no need to add instructions on how to install them.
